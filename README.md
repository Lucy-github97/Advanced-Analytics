# Advanced-Analytics
Context
For this Achievement, I selected my own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, youâ€™ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help you test your hypotheses.
The results of the analyses will be presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard. Data dashboards are an effective tool for, among other purposes, presenting data in an accessible and tangible way. The dashboard will tell the story of my analytical journey.
